## Credifica

## :page_with_curl: About

I was challenged to develop a part of the flow of a loan system, basically the registration part of a loan application and the visualization of it.

The challenge descriptions are available at this link
The Front End of the application made in Next.js is hosted [here](https://credifica.vercel.app/)
The application's Back End was done in Node.js with Express and MongoDB, and is hosted [here](https://credifica.herokuapp.com/)
